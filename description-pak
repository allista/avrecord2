AVRecord is an audio-video recorder with motion and noise detection. It constantly monitors a video stream from a v4l device looking for difference between consequent frames. It may also monitor sound level in a stream captured by a sound card. While waiting for motion or noise it buffers data. When something is detected buffered data is written out so the precise moment of the event's beginning is not clipped.
